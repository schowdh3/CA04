# CA04: Analysis of COVID-19 data using Python

This notebook contains a Python-based analysis of COVID-19 data from around the world. The analysis uses data from the "Our World in Data" project, which aggregates data from multiple sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and national health agencies.

# Data
The COVID-19 data used in this analysis is publicly available and can be accessed through the following link: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data

The data is updated on a daily basis and includes information on confirmed cases, deaths, testing, and vaccination for each country and region in the world.

# Analysis
The analysis of the COVID-19 data is conducted using Python, a popular programming language for data analysis and visualization. The notebook uses the following Python libraries:

1. Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
2. Matplotlib: for data visualization
3. Seaborn: for advanced data visualization

The notebook is divided into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the COVID-19 data. The sections include:

1. Data loading and cleaning: where the data is loaded into the notebook and cleaned for analysis
2. Overall trends: where overall trends in the COVID-19 data are analyzed and visualized
3. Regional analysis: where the COVID-19 data is analyzed and visualized for different regions of the world
4. Vaccination analysis: where the COVID-19 vaccination data is analyzed and visualized
5. Conclusion: where the main findings of the analysis are summarized and discussed

# Running the notebook
To run this notebook, you will need to have access to a Python environment, such as Anaconda or Jupyter. You can also run the notebook on Google Colab by clicking on the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the notebook.

Before running the notebook, you will need to install the required Python libraries, which can be done by running the following command in your Python environment:

!pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Once the required libraries are installed, you can run each section of the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
